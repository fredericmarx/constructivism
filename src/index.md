## About

What happens when a construction moves from code to print, or from code to space? What gets lost? What stays the same? Ode to Construction – Abstraction in the digital age demonstrates the fluidity of a design’s materialization within the conditions of the digital. Constructed from pixels and data, transformed into vector files, travelling through the cloud to an offset printer, and translated into physical metal objects – the project moves effortlessly between screen, print, and space and questions the context and medium.

Ode to Construction – Abstraction in the digital age started as an investigation into the visual strategies and ideologies of Russia’s early 20th century Suprematist and Constructivist movements. Graphic designer Polina Joffe examined these historic movements and searched for ways to reanimate their ideologies and foundational legacies from a contemporary graphic designer’s viewpoint. She designed a generative tool that enables her as well as others to automatically create constructions of red and black rectangles, which stylistically echo modernist abstraction. With the generative tool on this website, Joffe created a set of compositions that fill the pages of the accompanying publication and physical, metallic installation that is on view at Onomatopee Projects (NL)  throughout October.

Website visitors are urged to create their own constructions and save the generated artworks in high definition, ready for production.

## Artist’s Letter

Ode to Construction began as an investigation into the visual strategies and ideologies of Russia’s Suprematist and Constructivist movements. I call it an “ode” for several reasons, but primarily because I’m referencing the love affair design has had with the aesthetics of modernism for decades, including my own love affair. My ode—somewhat melancholically, and also as an homage—examines these historic movements from a contemporary graphic designer’s viewpoint; it’s an ode to the idealism of the Russian avant-garde, to a utopian notion of transforming art into a medium that serves everyone, to the collapsing of distinctions between art and design. For my ode, I’ve designed a generative tool to automatically create constructions of red and black rectangles, which stylistically echo modernist abstraction. With this program, available at odetoconstruction.com, users can create their own free “artworks” with the click of a button. This book features generated outcomes of this digital tool.

Constructed from pixels and data, transformed into vector files, forming electric light beams on the screen before travelling through the cloud to an offset printer to become two inks on paper, the constructions in this book began life in one medium and ended in another. Similarly, the project’s accompanying exhibition (taking place at Onomatopee Projects in Fall 2020) features forms generated from code, but materialized as a temporary installation. My primary interest is in inviting the audience to question medium and context: What happens when a construction moves from code to print, or from code to space? What gets lost? What stays the same?

I myself come to this history from my perspective as a graphic designer, working with print, typography, space, and shapes every day. Having left Russia for Finland as a two-year old before the fall of the Soviet Union, the forms of Russian abstraction have followed me throughout my life like a shadow. Ode to Construction’s color palette is red, white, and black, and therefore it references the aesthetics of the movements with which I’m engaged. But the colors also reference the lexicon of typography, and the typographic standard of black on white with red is an accent colour. For designers like myself, this palette is often the starting point. So it became the starting point for me here too.
