## About

Art must not be concentrated in dead shrines called museums. It must be spread everywhere – on the streets, in the trams, factories, workshops, and in the workers’ homes.

A multidisciplinary project exploring the intersection of design, art and architecture. The project uses the means of a generative web application, a publication and a large scale spatial installation.

The Ode includes a total of 400 generated compositions that are arranged based on the complexity of input parameters. The generator was created by Leonid Joffe and Frederic Marx.

It is encouraged to save the composi- tions produced and print them for your own use using the online generator. Available at odetoconstructivism.com
